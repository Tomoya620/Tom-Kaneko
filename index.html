		<p><font size= "4" color="#ffffff"> I haven't attended Taiwanese wedding before, so this was my first time to go through this kind of experience. My parents and my cousins also attended the wedding with me. During the wedding, I found out that lots of things were different compared to the wedding I had participated before. </font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#ffffff"> When people show up in a wedding, they are usually blessing for the bride and groom. For me, there are many reasons why I attending this wedding. One of the reasons is that I want to see that what is the difference of wedding between each culture. Another reason is that this wedding is for my parents' friends, so due to this relationship, I need to attend it.</font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#ffffff"> Throughout the wedding, I chatted with many people, even with the people that I have never met before. The host created a wonderful atmosphere and everyone enjoyed it.</font></p>
		<p><font size= "4" color="#ffffff"> This is my first time for attending this kind of wedding, although it was quite different than what I thought, I still find it interesting. If there is another opportunity for me to attend the Taiwanese wedding, I would definitely join it and get more understanding of Taiwanese culture. </font></p>
